							<h1>0.4 GANG</h1>
							<p class="major">The 0.4 Gang is a tight-knit group of four friends who share a special bond built on trust, laughter, and endless adventures. They call themselves the 0.4 Gang because, despite their differences, they are always in perfect sync, like the perfect equation. Whether it's late-night hangouts, spontaneous road trips, or supporting each other through thick and thin, the 0.4 Gang is inseparable. Their motto? "Together, we re 0.4, but united, we re unstoppable." <a href="https://html5up.net"></a><a href="https://html5up.net/license"></a>.</p>

							<h2>Mohd riyas</h2>
							<p>Muhammed Riyas, a known member of the 0.4 gang, is the kind of guy who keeps a tight grip on his cash. While he is always around for the fun, getting him to lend money is almost impossible. He is smart with his spending, always finding ways to dodge unnecessary expenses. His friends know that if they ever need cash, Riyas is not the one to ask—he will either laugh it off or come up with the perfect excuse. But despite his reluctance to part with money, he s still a solid friend, always showing up when it matters (just not with his wallet open)..</p>

							<h2>Mohd Fasil</h2>
							<p>Muhammed Fasil, another member of the 0.4 gang, is the ultimate excuse master when it comes to travel plans. No matter how exciting the trip sounds, he will always find a reason to back out—bad weather, too expensive, too far, or just plain bad vibes. His negativity is almost legendary, always pointing out the worst-case scenario before anything even happens. While the rest of the gang is hyped about an adventure, Fasil is the one shaking his head, finding faults in every plan. But despite his never-ending excuses, he is still part of the squad—just as long as no one expects him to pack a bag and join in..</p>
